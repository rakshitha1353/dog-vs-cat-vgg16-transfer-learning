# Dog vs. Cat Image Classification using VGG16 Transfer Learning

This repository contains code for a dog vs. cat image classification model, built using transfer learning with the pre-trained VGG16 convolutional neural network.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to effectively use transfer learning to build an image classifier. We leverage the VGG16 model, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, and fine-tune it for the specific task of distinguishing between dog and cat images.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the "Dogs vs. Cats" dataset, available on Kaggle:

* [Dogs vs. Cats](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salader/dogs-vs-cats)

The dataset is downloaded and extracted within the code.

## Dependencies

* Python 3.x
* TensorFlow/Keras
* PIL (Pillow)
* Requests
* Matplotlib
* Kaggle API (for downloading the dataset)

You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow pillow requests matplotlib kaggle

## Code Structure
your_script_name.py: The main Python script containing the code for loading the data, building the model, training, and evaluating it.

Model Architecture
The model uses the VGG16 architecture with the following modifications:

The fully connected layers at the top of the VGG16 model are removed.
A new fully connected layer with 256 neurons and ReLU activation is added.
A final output layer with a single neuron and sigmoid activation is added for binary classification.
The convolutional base of the VGG16 model is frozen to prevent its weights from being updated during training. This is a crucial step in transfer learning.

Training
The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss. The training process includes:

Data preprocessing (normalization).
Training for 10 epochs.
Evaluation on the validation set.

Results
The script will generate plots showing the training and validation accuracy and loss. The model's performance on a test image is also demonstrated.

test_image = load_img('/content/dogs_vs_cats/test/cats/cat.10000.jpg',target_size=(150,150))
test_image = img_to_array(test_image)

test_image = test_image.reshape(1,test_image.shape[0],test_image.shape[1],test_image.shape[2])
test_image = preprocess_input(test_image)
result = model.predict(test_image)
i=0
if (result>0.5):
    print('dog')
else:
    print('cat')

Future Improvements
Experiment with different hyperparameters.
Implement data augmentation to improve model generalization.
Fine-tune the convolutional base of VGG16 for better performance.
Save the model, and create a script for easy inference.
Deploy the model.
